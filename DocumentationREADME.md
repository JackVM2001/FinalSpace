Summary of project goals:
Goals for this project was for me to take the tools that I have learned this semester and apply them. And I think over all I did a decent job at doing it. I pulled things from earlier this semester like random nature and incorporated other concepts like math, different classes to name a few. I took this project step by step. Started with the bullet class and built and incorporated different classes from there. I was also very cautious slow going with this project because in the past I have jumped and confused my self by going 100 mph instead of 55. One goal I was proud of making here was applying the orbits. 

Instructions Players need:
This game is fairly simple. All you do is shoot the target. Ah but there is a catch because the spaceman sprite only shoots to the right. So you have to be patient and catch the right bounce or orbit. In order to shoot press the space bar. The game will stop on its own when the bullet makes contact with the target so if you want to play again just run the program again. 

List of technologies used:
Pygame module
Space module
Random module
simpleGE module

sprite creation
uploading images
math for the orbits gravitate
shooting space bullets
bouncing and hiding motion for spaceman and bullets
collision sounding
random.randit for sprite generation

Description of my process:
During this project I learned a lot. I used a lot of new techniques like how to manipulate code in another module to save space in the actual file. I learned how to use geometry and physics to create complex orbits. I learned how to use multiple classes and figured out how they all mesh and work together. This whole project was a learning process for me.

I got very stuck trying to figure out collisions. I tried to use some of the techniques from the coin game collisions but it was a different problem than what I was solving in this game. I only had one target and not multiple like the coins. But after a lot of hair pulling and deleting figured out it was a simple for loop. Always the simple things.

What wouldnâ€™t I like to improve on this project. I would have liked to get an ending screen with it but I simply ran out of time to add one. I would have also liked to add come sort of time and counting mechanism to make it a little more challenging, fun, and clean.

Next time I would attack this in spirts. I would stretch my goals out a little more. I would just set a lot of micro goals and milestones. I went at this project all at once and I think that hurt me by overwhelming and confusing me. 

I unfortunately strayed pretty far from the game design. I had the same fundamentals that I originally had set off trying to attempt. I wanted to use orbits and bullets both of those things I had never attempted. I had wanted originally to have 2 planets and not have the spaceman float freely. When I would go in to try and add details I would end up confusing my self and the game and it would crash.

I stayed on track by setting goals. I would complete a class and take a break. I would set a rule or a bound and take a break. That being said I could have broken up the goals more to not overwhelm me but that is mainly how I stayed on track.
